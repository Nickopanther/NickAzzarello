        <h3>Computers</h3>
        <p>I have been interested in computers at a very young age. I started playing countless CD-ROMs and surfed the internet on AOL for many years. I have played on countless types of computers like Windows 3.1, Windows 98, Windows XP, and MacBook Pro. I have taken computer classes in high school to hone my skills in applicatons like Dreamweaver, Photshop, and Illustrator.</p>

        <h3>Making Videos</h3>
        <p>I have been making videos as early at the age of 6. I have enjoyed making numerous videos with my friends and post them on<span id="youtube"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Nickopanther00" target="_blank">YouTube.</a></span>We enjoy collaborationg and coming up with all sorts of skits we can try out. I first started making home movies on VHS and then later made videos on a digital camera and edit them using Windows Movie Maker or iMovie. At Kutztown University I increased my knowledge on video production through the Electronic Media program. </p>

        <h3>Guitar</h3>
        <p>I started playing the guitar at the age of 7. I have taken lessons for almost 10 years learning all sorts of notes and chords. I had the interest in playing the guitar from listening to a couple of Aerosmith songs. I joined the jazz band for guitar at my middle school and high school. I felt very confident in what I was doing since I had plenty of experience with the notes and chords. It was exciting performing and traveling to different schools and meeting people.</p>

        <h3>Piano</h3>
        <p>The piano is the second instrument I learned how to play at the age of 12. It was interesting learning another instrument while playing the guitar in a jazz band at school. It wasn't too hard understanding the notes on the keyboard because most of them were familiar to me from playing the guitar. I have taken lessons for five years and try to continue whenever I have enough time.</p>
