        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Welcome to my very first website! On this website you get an inside look on my life regarding my jobs, interests, and myself. I was born on September 15, 1992 and grew up in Wernersville, PA. I have become fascinated with computers and video from a very young age. I've used the computer since I was 3 and started making videos (starting with VHS cassettes) at the age of 6. I attended school at Conrad Weiser from kindergarden through eighth grade and moved to the Governor Mifflin area during my high school years.</p>
        <br />
        <p>
            I graduated from high school, at Governor Mifflin, in 2011 and got a job as a cashier at Redner's and started my college education at RACC. After two years of RACC, I transfered to Kutztown University to major in Electronic Media. During my time up at Kutztown, I have worked on a lot of video projects from a bunch of classes. I got to write and produce my own short projects and even shot the college's basketball games. Before graduation I got an internship at TC Motion in Lancaster where I was a production assistant on multiple projects.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>Now I am a recent graduate from Kutztown University with a bachelor's degree in Electronic Media. I am returning to RACC to get a certificate in Web Development as I work at my two new jobs, the<span id="royals"><a href="jobs.htm#royals">Reading Royals</a></span>and <span id="baseball"><a href="jobs.htm#phils">Fightin' Phils,</a></span> as a camera operator. I have been teaching myself how to code from all sorts of languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have been practicing using Codecademy and reading several For Dummies books on coding. I am currently working on my certificate in Web Development at Reading Area Community College. For my major at Kutztown University, I have been involved in multiple productions from class assignments to outside work. I worked as a boom operator for a short film that would soon be entered in a contest. I also volunteered as a camera operator for BCTV and participated in a club that would broadcast the university's local news.</p>

        <h3>Projects from Kutztown University</h3>
        <p>At Kutztown University I have made numerous video projects with the knowledge based off what I learned from my classes. I had the chance to script, shoot, and edit many projects and helped out on other projects.</p>

            <h4>TC Motion Internship</h4>
            <iframe width="340" height="240" controls="controls" video src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GD4s7KgjuOc" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p>In the summer of 2015, I applied for an internship at TC Motion in Lancaster, PA. During my internship, I observed and helped out on many commercial projects in the studio. I was a production assistant and key grip on all of their projects from lighting the set to changing the lens. It was an interesting and educational experience for me. This video provides a general overview on what I did during my internship.</p>

            <p>This is my demo reel that features a montage of the many projects I have done at Kutztown University. I majored in Electronic Media and got hands on experience with all of the aspects of video production. In these videos, I was the cinematographer and editor for all of the projects. Each video that appears provides a link to the full length video. I was also the writer, producer, and director on some as well.</p>

            <p>During my first semester at Kutztown, I had the opportunity to help a few students on a short film they were working on to submit to a contest. Being the boom operator was exciting and exhausting work. One can only hold a microphone on a fishpole in the air for so long. The short film focuses on Mark, a man who predicts what action he may take upon his girlfriend, Allison, as a negative turn.</p>
